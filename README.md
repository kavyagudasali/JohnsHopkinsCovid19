Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction

This project involves the analysis and prediction of COVID-19 cases using data from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) COVID-19 Data Repository. The tasks include data analysis, forecasting future cases or deaths, and providing recommendations to government health departments.

## Project Structure

### Task 1: Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Prepare a comprehensive data analysis report on the COVID-19 dataset.
- **Description:** This section includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) that covers trends in confirmed cases and deaths at both country and US county levels. The analysis aims to identify patterns, trends, and key insights from the data.

### Task 2: Predictive Modeling
- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model to forecast COVID-19 cases or deaths.
- **Description:** A period is fixed for prediction, and models like time series analysis or machine learning techniques are used to forecast future cases or deaths for a specific country or region. The focus is on evaluating the model's accuracy and reliability.

### Task 3: Government Recommendations
- **Objective:** Provide actionable suggestions to the government health department based on model predictions.
- **Description:** Recommendations are tailored to help government health departments prepare for potential future outbreaks or manage ongoing situations more effectively, based on the predictions.

### Model Comparison Report
- **Description:** A report comparing the performance of various predictive models, with suggestions for the best model to use in production. Metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared are considered.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Description:** A report documenting the challenges faced during data analysis and modeling, along with the techniques used to overcome these issues, such as handling missing data or dealing with outliers.

## Dataset
The dataset includes confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths on a country level, as well as by US county, updated daily.
